# NHSBSA code club

This repository is for the August 2023 code club. 

In this session we will firstly be touching on how to use components from our own service manual, looking at Nunjucks vs HTML, before moving onto a deeper a dive into how to use and customise components from other deisgn systems.

## Installation

After cloning or downloading and extracting the zip file for this repository you will need to do a few things!

If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio Code, start a new terminal and run the following command:
